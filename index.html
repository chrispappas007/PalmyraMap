  <h1>Status of Notable Structures at Palmyra, Syria</h1>

  <section>

    <p>Map created by <a href="https://github.com/chrispappas007">Christina Pappas</a></p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra">Palmyra</a> is a <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/23">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>.</p>
    <p>Palmyra is located at an oasis in the Syrian desert. It became an important city in the ancient world linking
      trade routes to Persia, India, and China with the Roman Empire. Palmyra had sustained minor damage during the Syrian Civil War, but its occupation by ISIS has lead to widespread damage from looting and the intentional destruction of structures.
      The <a href="http://www.newpalmyra.org/">#NEWPALMYRA</a> project has been working with archaeologists, museums, and other researchers to collect images of the structures at Palmyra and create 3D models that will be in the public domain.
      The Getty Institute recently launched its first vitural <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/exhibitions_events/exhibitions/palmyra/">exhibit</a> focusing exclusively on its rare print and photograph collection of Palmyra.</p>
